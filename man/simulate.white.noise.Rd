simulate.white.noise
}
\description{
simulate.white.noise simulates the rate along a phylogeneti tree according to a white noise process. In particular, it samples from a lognormal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation. For each branch a rate is drawn from a distribution with the given mean. The standard deviation is divided by the branch length divided by the mean of the branch lengths. As a result, the rate of a long branch will be drawn from a distribution with a lower standard deviation than that for a short branch (i.e. the rate is more uncertain for shorter branches). 
}
\usage{
simulate.white.noise(tree, params = list(mean.log = -3.9, sd.log = 0.1))
}
\arguments{
  \item{tree}{
A phylogenetic tree of class 'phylo'. The branch lengths should be in units of time (a chronogram).
}
  \item{params}{A list with the parameters for the simulation function, corresponding to the following two items:}
  \item{mean.log}{The mean of the lognormal distribution. It should be in log scale}
  \item{sd.log}{The standard deviation of the lognormal distribution. The actual value used for each branch will vary inversely with the branch length. See the description of the function}
}

\details{
None
}
\value{
An object of class 'ratesim'. This is a list with two items:
 \item{phylogram }{The phylogenetic tree with branch lengths in units of substitutions (phylogram)}
 \item{tree.data.matrix }{This is a matrix with the number of substitutions, rates, and times along every branch in the tree. See get.tree.data.matrix for more details}
