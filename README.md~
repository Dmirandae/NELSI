This is the home of NELSI: Nucleotide Evolutionary rate Simulator

This is the list of potential functions:

- molrate.sim (currently molrate.sim.tree)
  - ~~strict clock X~~
  - ~~uncorrelated lognormal X~~
  - ~~uncorrelated exponential~~
  - uncorrelated gamma
  - ~~autocorrelated Kishino (2001) X~~
  - ~~autocorrelated Thorne (1998) X~~
  - ?White noise
  - Time dependent exponential decay

- ~~get.tree.data.matrix~~

- get.rate.descendant.pairs

- allnode.times (if used for substitutions and time, then it can be used for linear regression to test for clocklike behaviour as in path-o-gen)

- mid.ages

- pathnode with modifications ( for Node density effect)

- NEW plot rates trough time along lineages


The dependencies are:
