The original simulations are:

    - SC
      rate = 0.005, noise = rnorm(n, 0, 0.0001)
    - UCLN-L
      mean.rate = 0.005, sd = 0.1
    - UCLN-H
      mean.rate = 0.005, sd = 0.3
    - UCG-L # shape = alpha, rate = beta
      alpha = 10, beta = 10^5 (10^4)
    - UCG-H
      alpha = 1, beta = 10^4 (10^3)
    - ACLN-L
      rate = 0.005, v = 0.3
    - ACLN-M
      rate = 0.005, v = 0.2
    - ACLN-H
      rate = 0.005, v = 0.1

Ten data sets per simulation settings, with a root age of 10 time units. In all cases, the number of variable sites is between 5300 and 4800 in alignments of 10000 variable sites

Use rate that are 1 order of magnitude lower, as Reviewer 1 suggests.
#    TODO   
    - Check sequence variation. It should be around 500 variables sites
