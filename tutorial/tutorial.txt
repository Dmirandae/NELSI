1. Installation and setup
-------------------------

NELSI requires a recent version of R (>=2.5). If R is not installed in your machine, download and install the appropriate version [here](www.r-project.org). 

R packages can be downloaded and installed directly from [github](github.com/sebastianduchene/nelsi) with the package [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools). This is the easiest way to install NELSI (and many other packages). 

We will begin by installing devtools from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Please follow the instructions bellow:

 - Open the R console by clicking on the R icon in your desktop or in Applications (depending on the operating system)

 - Make sure that you have an internet connection and type in the code bellow:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Follow the instructions in the prompt. 

 - Load devtools with the following code:

```
library(devtools)
```

 - The devtools package has a function to download packages from github repositories. To download and install NELSI type the following at the prompt:

```
install_github(rep = "NELSI", username = "sebastianduchene")
```

 - NELSI is now installed. To make all the functions available, load the package by typing:

```{r}
library(NELSI)
```

 - This is all for the installation of NELSI. Please contact the authors to report any bugs.


2. Loading phylogenetic trees
-----------------------------

To simulate rates of evolution we need a phylogenetic tree in which the branch lengths repesetn units of time, known as a chronogram. We can simulate a tree in R, but for this tutorial we will load the tree in the example_data folder in [github](github.com/sebastianduchene/nelsi). 

- Set the R working directory to the example_data folder. Load the example tree with the following code:

```{r}
myTree <- read.tree("tr_example.tree")
```
